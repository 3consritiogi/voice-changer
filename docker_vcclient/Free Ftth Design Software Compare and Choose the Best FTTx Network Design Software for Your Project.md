# Free FTTH Design Software: A Comparison of Three Options
 
Fiber to the Home (FTTH) is a technology that delivers high-speed internet and other services through optical fiber cables directly to the premises of end-users. FTTH network design is a complex and time-consuming process that requires careful planning, optimization, and documentation. To facilitate this task, there are various software tools available that can help with different aspects of FTTH design, such as geospatial analysis, network inventory, cost estimation, material management, and reporting. In this article, we will compare three free FTTH design software options that you can use for your projects.
 
## Geospatial Network Inventory FREE
 
Geospatial Network Inventory FREE (GNI FREE) is a free version of telecom network inventory system GNI. The solution was prepared for the telecom operators and companies that plan, design and build FTTH networks. The application architecture is based on the QGIS geospatial platform. By combining a wide range of QGIS vector libraries and FTTH/GPON engineering rules we were able to create a product automating the work in designing a concept of the planned fibre optic network[^1^].

Some of the features of GNI FREE are:
 
- Predefined layers used to execute activities supporting FTTH planning
- Configuration of the forms appearance presenting data about the features in predefined layers
- Symbology for the predefined layers
- FTTH/GPON Planner plugin that allows you to create and edit FTTH network elements such as splitters, cabinets, ducts, cables, and fibers
- Document generation plugin that allows you to export your network design to PDF or Excel formats
